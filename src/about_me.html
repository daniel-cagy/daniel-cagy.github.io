        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Daniel Cagy — an Artificial Intelligence student at <span>PUC-Rio</span>, Brazil, focused on 
            <span>software engineering</span>, <span>cybersecurity</span>, <span>embedded systems</span>, and 
            <span>web development</span>. 
            I enjoy integrating <span>software and hardware</span> to solve real-world problems and create better user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I work mainly with <span>Python</span>, <span>Rust</span>, <span>C</span>, <span>C++</span>, and, of course, 
            <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span> — but I’m always exploring new technologies and programming paradigms.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I’d like to share a few of my main hobbies, since they play a big role in shaping how I think and create.
        </p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>
            The obvious one first.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started programming at 16 after watching the <span>CS50 lectures</span> on YouTube — and I’ve been hooked ever since. 
            Solving problems, building from scratch, and watching an idea come alive after hours of debugging is deeply satisfying to me.
        </p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoy mostly <span>single-player</span>, <span>story-driven</span>, and <span>strategy/simulation</span> games. 
            They’re not just entertainment — they inspire <span>creativity</span> and <span>strategic thinking</span>, both of which often influence how I approach my projects. 
            One of my earliest motivations for learning to code was actually to create my own games someday.
        </p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            I’m passionate about <span>progressive rock</span> and <span>metal</span>, though my taste is fairly broad. 
            Music helps me relax and focus, especially while coding — and sometimes, complex music even inspires complex code.
        </p>

        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>
            I also love <span>weight training</span>. 
            It balances my sedentary coding routine and clears my mind — it’s my reset button before diving back into technical work.
        </p>

            <h2>Programming Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I believe programming isn’t just about writing code — it’s about writing <span>clean</span>, 
                <span>efficient</span>, and <span>maintainable</span> code. 
                I constantly try to refine my skills and follow best practices to become a better engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also a big fan of <span>terminal-based environments</span> like <span>Vim</span> and <span>Neovim</span> — they keep me fast and focused. 
                Even when I use full IDEs like <span>VSCode</span>, <span>CLion</span>, or <span>PyCharm</span>, I always enable <span>Vim motions</span> — it just feels right.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think software should be <span>optimized</span>, even in small projects. 
                Many people assume optimization only matters for large-scale systems, but I disagree — bloated software ruins user experience at any scale. 
                My goal is to write code that’s <span>efficient</span> <em>and</em> <span>readable</span>, finding the sweet spot between performance and clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, programming is more than a skill to me — it’s how I <span>think</span>, <span>learn</span>, and <span>express ideas</span>.
